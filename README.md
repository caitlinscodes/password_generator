# Caitlin Stevenson|Password Generator Assignment

## Objectives

In this project, I attempted to create a random password generator using vanilla javascript functions. When the user selects the "generate password" button on the home screen they are prompted with several questions to let the generator know which character types can be used and the desired password length. Following the prompts the generator randomly selects characters from several different character arrays and pushes the results to the home page. The user can then select the "generate password" button again to create a new password.
